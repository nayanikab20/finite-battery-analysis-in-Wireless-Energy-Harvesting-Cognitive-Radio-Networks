# Finite-Battery-Analysis-in-Wireless-Energy-Harvesting-Cognitive-Radio-Networks

These files use monte carlo simulations to simulate the outage probability of a Wireless Energy Harvested Cognitive Radio Network(WEH CRN) for infinite battery and finite battery capacity constraint. The discharge model of the battery is considered to be linear.

To read my paper that describes this work - 'Wireless Energy Harvesting Cognitive Radio Networks unfer finite capacity battery for Nakagami-m fading' 

To get a clearer understanding of the WEHCRNS(with infinite battery capacity, ie all the energy harvested by the secondary source(SS) can be stored and used for information transmission by the SS) read this paper - https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7342973
