# Finite-Battery-Analysis-in-Wireless-Energy-Harvesting-Cognitive-Radio-Networks

These files use monte carlo simulations to simulate the outage probability of a Wireless Energy Harvested Cognitive Radio Network(WEH CRN) for infinite battery and finite battery capacity constraint. The discharge model of the battery is considered to be linear.
