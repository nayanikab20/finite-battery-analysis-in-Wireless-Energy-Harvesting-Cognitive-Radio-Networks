The outputs of the matlab files have been presented and discussed in the results section of my paper 'Wireless Energy Harvesting Cognitive Radio NEtworkds under Finite Capacity Battery for Nakagami-m fading'
Linear battery model has been assumed in the paper. Non-linear battery model will be considered in the future works.
